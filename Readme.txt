## Code Quality

We are dealing here different projects here and make sure we need to follow minimum code quality for all projects. Here list of things we need to follow

1. Chioce of data types and strucures
    Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks.

2. Use of loops and conditional statements
    Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly.

3. Use of packages
    Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks such as reading and writing files and creating visualizations.

4. Use of functions
    Functions are used to reduce repetitive code.

5. Use of good coding practices
    Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.
